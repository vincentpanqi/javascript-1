		<mark>'use strict';</mark>

	<pre>
		Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope. That means, they are only visible within that function.

		Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

		function myTest() {
		  var loc = "foo";
		  console.log(loc);
		}
		myTest(); // "foo"
		console.log(loc); // "undefined"
		loc is not defined outside of the function.

		Instructions
		Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope. Run the tests and then follow the instructions commented out in the editor.
	</pre>
	<script>
		function myLocalScope() {
		  'use strict';
		  //?????????????????????????????????
		  var myVar = "xgqfrms";
		  //local
		  // myVar = "xgqfrms";
		  // ok without 'use strict';
		  // Uncaught ReferenceError: myVar is not defined
		  // global myVar = "xgqfrms";
		  // Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
		  console.log("myVar1 = "+myVar);
		}
		myLocalScope();

		// Run and check the console
		// myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
		console.log("myVar2 = "+myVar);

		// Now remove the console log line to pass the test
