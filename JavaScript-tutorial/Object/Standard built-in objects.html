			Standard objects by category
			Value properties

			These global properties return a simple value; they have no properties or methods.

			Infinity
			NaN
			undefined
			null literal
			Function properties

			These global functions—functions which are called globally rather than on an object—directly return their results to the caller.

			eval()
			uneval() 
			isFinite()
			isNaN()
			parseFloat()
			parseInt()
			decodeURI()
			decodeURIComponent()
			encodeURI()
			encodeURIComponent()
			escape() 
			unescape() 
			Fundamental objects

			These are the fundamental, basic objects upon which all other objects are based. This includes objects that represent general objects, functions, and errors.

			Object
			Function
			Boolean
			Symbol
			Error
			EvalError
			InternalError
			RangeError
			ReferenceError
			SyntaxError
			TypeError
			URIError
			Numbers and dates

			These are the base objects representing numbers, dates, and mathematical calculations.

			Number
			Math
			Date
			Text processing

			These objects represent strings and support manipulating them.

			String
			RegExp
			Indexed collections

			These objects represent collections of data which are ordered by an index value. This includes (typed) arrays and array-like constructs.

			Array
			Int8Array
			Uint8Array
			Uint8ClampedArray
			Int16Array
			Uint16Array
			Int32Array
			Uint32Array
			Float32Array
			Float64Array
			Keyed collections

			These objects represent collections which use keys; these contain elements which are iterable in the order of insertion.

			Map
			Set
			WeakMap
			WeakSet
			Vector collections

			SIMD vector data types are objects where data is arranged into lanes.

			SIMD 
			SIMD.Float32x4 
			SIMD.Float64x2 
			SIMD.Int8x16 
			SIMD.Int16x8 
			SIMD.Int32x4 
			SIMD.Uint8x16 
			SIMD.Uint16x8 
			SIMD.Uint32x4 
			SIMD.Bool8x16 
			SIMD.Bool16x8 
			SIMD.Bool32x4 
			SIMD.Bool64x2 
			Structured data

			These objects represent and interact with structured data buffers and data coded using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

			ArrayBuffer
			SharedArrayBuffer 
			Atomics 
			DataView
			JSON
			Control abstraction objects

			Promise
			Generator
			GeneratorFunction
			Reflection

			Reflect
			Proxy
			Internationalization

			Additions to the ECMAScript core for language-sensitive functionalities.

			Intl
			Intl.Collator
			Intl.DateTimeFormat
			Intl.NumberFormat
			Non-standard objects

			Iterator 
			ParallelArray 
			StopIteration 
			Other

			arguments
