	<div>

			We can use the join method to join each element of an array into a string separated by whatever delimiter you provide as an argument.

			The following is an example of using join to join all of the elements of an array into a string with all the elements separated by word and:

			var veggies = ["Celery", "Radish", "Carrot", "Potato"];
			var salad = veggies.join(" and ");
			console.log(salad); // "Celery and Radish and Carrot and Potato" 
			
		</pre>
	</div>
	<script>
		var joinMe = ["Split","me","into","an","array"];
		var joinedString = '';

		// Only change code below this line.

		joinedString = joinMe.join(" ");//space
		console.log("joinedString = "+joinedString);
		//Split me into an array
	</script>
