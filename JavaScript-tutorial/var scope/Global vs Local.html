		It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.

		In this example:

		var someVar = "Hat";
		function myFun() {
		  var someVar = "Head";
		  return someVar;
		}
		The function myFun will return "Head" because the local version of the variable is present.

		In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

		Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with var.

		Instructions
		Using var, declare a global variable myGlobal outside of any function. Initialize it with a value of 10.

		Inside function fun1, assign 5 to oopsGlobal without using the var keyword.

		Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope. That means, they are only visible within that function.

		Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

		function myTest() {
		  var loc = "foo";
		  console.log(loc);
		}
		myTest(); // "foo"
		console.log(loc); // "undefined"
		loc is not defined outside of the function.
