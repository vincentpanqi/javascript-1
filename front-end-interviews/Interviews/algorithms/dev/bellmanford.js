/**
 * Bellman Ford Algorithm
 *
 * computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices 
 * in a weighted digraph.[1] It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same 
 * problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some 
 * of the edge weights are negative numbers.
